This analysis has been conducted on a data set of electricity demand and
prices for five Australian states (NSW, QLD, SA, VIC & TAS) in 2020. There are four
distinct sections of the analysis below, the first looks at boxplots to display 
total demand and demand per capita distributions for each state. The second is 
a line graph tracking total demand and demand per capita for each state over the 
course of a year. The third section is scatterplots of each states demand per 
capita compared to the average price (outliers have not been removed from this 
data). The final section is a line graph of the hourly demand per capita of each 
state. Following all this, numerical summaries for the boxplots and scatterplots
have also been provided in the form of a five number summary and correlation
analysis.

The data used for this analysis is found in the zip folder labeled 'Data Files'.

Plots for this code are found in the 'Output' folder.
